     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If these requirements are not met the {@link InvalidRequestMessageException} exception
     * is thrown.
     *
     * <p>Here's an example of CBOR which conforms to this requirement:
     * <pre>
     *   ItemsRequest = {
     *     ? "docType" : DocType,
     *     "nameSpaces" : NameSpaces,
     *     ? "RequestInfo" : {* tstr =&gt; any} ; Additional info the reader wants to provide
     *   }

     *   DocType = tstr
     *
     *   NameSpaces = {
     *     + NameSpace =&gt; DataElements    ; Requested data elements for each NameSpace
     *   }
     *
     *   NameSpace = tstr

     *   DataElement = tstr
     *   IntentToRetain = bool
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>If mdoc session encryption is used (e.g. if {@link #createEphemeralKeyPair()} has been
     * called) and if {@link #setSessionTranscript(byte[])} was called, the X and Y
     * coordinates of the public part of the key-pair previously generated by
     * {@link #createEphemeralKeyPair()} must appear somewhere in the bytes of the CBOR. Each of
     * these coordinates must appear encoded with the most significant bits first and use the
     * exact amount of bits indicated by the key size of the ephemeral keys. For example, if the
     * ephemeral key is using the P-256 curve then the 32 bytes for the X coordinate encoded with
     * the most significant bits first must appear somewhere in the CBOR and ditto for the 32
     * bytes for the Y coordinate.
     *
     * <p>If {@code readerAuth} is not {@code null} it must be the bytes of a {@code COSE_Sign1}
     * structure as defined in RFC 8152. For the payload nil shall be used and the
     * detached payload is the ReaderAuthenticationBytes CBOR described below.
     * <pre>
     *     ReaderAuthentication = [
     *       "ReaderAuthentication",
     *       SessionTranscript,
     *       ItemsRequestBytes

     *     ReaderAuthenticationBytes = #6.24(bstr .cbor ReaderAuthentication)
     * </pre>

     *
     * <p>The public key corresponding to the key used to make the signature, can be found in the
     * {@code x5chain} unprotected header element of the {@code COSE_Sign1} structure (as as
     * described in
     * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-x509-04">draft-ietf-cose-x509-04</a>).
     * There will be at least one certificate in said element and there may be more (and if so,
     * each certificate must be signed by its successor).
     *
     * <p>Data elements protected by reader authentication are returned if, and only if, they are
     * mentioned in {@code requestMessage}, {@code requestMessage} is signed by the top-most
     * certificate in the reader's certificate chain, and the data element is configured
     * with an {@link AccessControlProfile} configured with an X.509 certificate which appears
     * in the certificate chain.
     *
     * <p>Note that only items referenced in {@code entriesToRequest} are returned - the
     * {@code requestMessage} parameter is used only for enforcing reader authentication.
     *
     * <p>The reason for having {@code requestMessage} and {@code entriesToRequest} as separate
     * parameters is that the former represents a request from the remote verifier device
     * (optionally signed) and this allows the application to filter the request to not include
