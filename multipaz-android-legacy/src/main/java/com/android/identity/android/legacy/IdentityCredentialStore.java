/**
 * An interface to a secure store for user identity documents.
 *
 * <p>This interface is deliberately fairly general and abstract.  To the extent possible,
 * specification of the message formats and semantics of communication with credential
 * verification devices and issuing authorities (IAs) is out of scope. It provides the
 * interface with secure storage but a credential-specific Android application will be
 * required to implement the presentation and verification protocols and processes
 * appropriate for the specific credential type.
 *
 * <p>The user of these APIs is assumed to be familiar with the
 * <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021</a>
 * standard, its glossary, and the concepts it introduces.
 *
 * <p>Multiple credentials can be created.  Each credential comprises:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A document type, which is a string.</li>
 *
 * <li>A set of namespaces, which serve to disambiguate value names. It is recommended
 * that namespaces be structured as reverse domain names so that IANA effectively serves
 * as the namespace registrar.</li>
 *
 * <li>For each namespace, a set of name/value pairs, each with an associated set of
 * access control profile IDs.  Names are strings and values are typed and can be any
 * value supported by <a href="http://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>.</li>
 *
 * <li>A set of access control profiles, each with a profile ID and a specification
 * of the conditions which satisfy the profile's requirements.</li>
 *
 * <li>An asymmetric key pair which is used to authenticate the credential to the Issuing
 * Authority, called the <em>CredentialKey</em>.</li>
 *
 * <li>A set of zero or more named reader authentication public keys, which are used to
 * authenticate an authorized reader to the credential.</li>
 *
 * <li>A set of named signing keys, which are used to sign collections of values and session
 * transcripts.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementing support for user identity documents in secure storage requires dedicated
 * hardware-backed support and may not always be available. In addition to hardware-backed
 * Identity Credential support (which is only available in Android 11 and later and only
 * if the device has support for the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/refs/heads/master/identity/aidl/android/hardware/identity/IIdentityCredentialStore.aidl">Identity Credential HAL</a>),
 * this Jetpack has an Android Keystore backed implementation (also known as the "keystore"
 * implementation) which works on any Android device with API level 24 or later.
 *
 * <p>The Identity Credential API is designed to be able to evolve and change over time
 * but still provide 100% backwards compatibility. This is complicated by the fact that
 * there may be a version skew between the API used by the application and the version
 * implemented in secure hardware. To solve this problem, the API provides for a way
 * for the application to query for the version of the API implemented in the store
 * through {@link #getFeatureVersion()}. Known feature versions correspond to Android
 * releases and currently include {@link #FEATURE_VERSION_202009}, {@link #FEATURE_VERSION_202101},
 * and {@link #FEATURE_VERSION_202201}.
 *
 * <p>The keystore-based store is designed so it implements all capabilities that don't
 * explicitly require hardware features so will always implement the latest feature version
 * defined in this library. Each of the methods in that class will state whether it's implemented
 * in the keystore-based implementation.
 *
 * <p>When provisioning a document, applications should use either
 * {@link #getHardwareInstance(Context)} or {@link #getKeystoreInstance(Context, File)}
 * to obtain an {@link IdentityCredentialStore} instance and prefer the former if it
 * meets the app's feature version requirement, if any.
 *
 * <p>Apart from hardware- vs keystore-backed, two different flavors of credential stores exist -
 * the <em>default</em> store and the <em>direct access</em> store. Most often credentials will
 * be accessed through the default store but that requires that the Android device be powered up
 * and fully functional. It is desirable to allow identity credential usage when the Android
 * device's battery is too low to boot the Android operating system, so direct access to the
 * secure hardware via NFC may allow data retrieval, if the secure hardware chooses to implement it.
 *
 * <p>Credentials provisioned to the direct access store should <strong>always</strong> use reader
 * authentication to protect data elements. The reason for this is user authentication or user
 * approval of data release is not possible when the device is off.
