/**
 * Abstraction for data transfer between prover and verifier devices.
 *
 *
 * The data transfer is packetized, that is, data is delivered at the same
 * granularity as it is sent. For example, if [.sendMessage] is used to send
 * `N` bytes then this blob is what the remote peer will receive in the
 * [Listener.onMessageReceived] callback.
 *
 *
 * Instances constructed from subclasses deriving from this class must be inert when
 * constructed, that is, they must not do anything. This constraint exists to easily facilitate
 * factory-patterns.
 *
 *
 * If an unrecoverable error is detected, this is conveyed using the
 * [Listener.onError] callback.
 *
 *
 * This class can be used to implement both provers and verifiers.
