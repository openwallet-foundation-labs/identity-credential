     * [CredentialPresentmentData] after executing the request would be:

     *       Member
     *         Match: mDL

     *       Member
     *         Match: Train Ticket Providence -> New York Penn Station

     * ```
     *   CredentialSet
     *     Option
     *       Member
     *         Match: mDL

     *         Match: Boarding Pass BOS -> SFO
     *         Match: Train Ticket Providence -> New York Penn Station
     * ```
     * which - depending on how the application constructs its user interface - may give the user
     * a simpler user interface for deciding which credentials to return.
