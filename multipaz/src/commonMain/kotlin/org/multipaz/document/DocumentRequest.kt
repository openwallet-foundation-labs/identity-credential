/**
 * Document request.
 *
 * This type is an abstraction of a request from a remote reader requesting one or more
 * pieces of data. Each piece of data is represented by the [DocumentRequest.DataElement]
 * type which includes a number of attributes. These abstractions are modeled after MDOC as
 * per ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 but can be used for other document formats organized in a similar
 * fashion.
 *
 * The intended use of this type is that it's generated when receiving the request from the
 * remote reader, using [org.multipaz.mdoc.util.MdocUtil.generateDocumentRequest]
 * or similar. The [DocumentRequest] can then be used - along with data from the original
 * request - to render a consent dialog that can be presented to the user. Additional input can
 * be gathered from the user and recorded in the [DocumentRequest] instance using the
 * [DocumentRequest.DataElement.setDoNotSend] method.
 *
 * Once the user consents to sending data to the remote reader, the [DocumentRequest]
 * can then be used with [org.multipaz.mdoc.util.MdocUtil.mergeIssuerNamesSpaces],
 * [org.multipaz.mdoc.response.DocumentGenerator], and [org.multipaz.mdoc.response.DeviceResponseGenerator]
 * to generate the resulting `DeviceResponse`. This CBOR can then be sent to the remote
 * reader.
 *
 * TODO: Should be removed since this is now obsoleted by List<ConsentField> in the wallet app.
 *
 * @param requestedDataElements A list of [DocumentRequest.DataElement] instances.
