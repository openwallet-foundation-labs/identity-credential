/**
 * An object that is associated with every [Document] in the [DocumentStore]; it is referenced by
 * [Document.metadata] field.
 *
 * An application should implement this interface and use it to store application-specific data.
 * A factory function for [DocumentMetadata] is passed as a parameter to [DocumentStore]
 * constructor. An application must implement at least the members in this interface but
 * should be free to add other application-specific data it may want to associate with
 * the document (e.g. which issuer this document came from).
 *
 * Each [Document] has an associated [DocumentMetadata] instance. This instance stays the same
 * for the lifetime of the [Document]. Its state should be saved to the persistent storage
 * every time it changes (see `saveFn` parameter to [DocumentMetadataFactory]), so that it can
 * be loaded in the future.
 *
 * Several fields (such as [displayName]) are predefined, so that common high-level utilities
 * in the UI layer such as can display something meaningful to the end user. Text strings are
 * presented to the user as-is, so they should be short and may need to be localized.

/**
 * Function that creates an instance of [DocumentMetadata].
 *
 * - `documentId` is [Document.identifier] for which [DocumentMetadata] is created
 * - `data` is data saved by the previously-existing [DocumentMetadata] for this document
 * - `saveFn` is a function that saves the state of this [DocumentMetadata] instance to the
 *    persistent storage
 *
 * There are two scenarios when [DocumentMetadata] is created.
 *
 * The first scenario is when a new [Document] is created using [DocumentStore.createDocument].
 * In this case, `data` is `null`. Once [DocumentMetadata] is created, it is initialized using
 * function passed to [DocumentStore.createDocument] method.
 *
 * The second scenario is when a previously-existing [Document] is loaded from the storage. In this
 * case `data` is equal to the byte string that was last saved by the previously-existing
 * [DocumentMetadata] for this document. If no data was saved, `data` is set to the empty byte
 * string.
 *
 * When the state of the [DocumentMetadata] instance changes, it should call `saveFn` and
 * save its state to the persistent storage, so it can be loaded in the future, however exact
 * timing of `saveFn` call is entirely up to the application.
 *
 * Additionally, every time `saveFn` is called, a [DocumentUpdated] event is emitted on
 * [DocumentStore.eventFlow].
