     * A helper for managing a set of [Credential]s.
     *
     * This helper provides a high-level way to manage credentials on a
     * [Document]. Its goal is to always have a fixed number of
     * credentials of a specific type available within the following constraints
     *
     * - If a credential is used more than `maxUsesPerCredential` times, a replacement is generated.
     * - If a credential expires within `minValidTimeMillis` milliseconds, a replacement is generated.
     *
     * This is all implemented on top of [Credential] creation
     * and [Credential.certify]. The application should examine the return
     * value and if positive, collect the not-yet-certified credentials via
     * [Document.pendingCredentials], send them to the issuer for certification,
     * and then call [Credential.certify] when receiving the certification
     * from the issuer.
     *
     * @param document the document to manage credentials for.
     * @param domain the domain to use for created credentials.
     * @param createCredential a lambda for creating the credential which only takes in an optional
     * parameter for a replacement credential. This must not be null if dryRun is false.
     * @param now the time right now, used for determining which existing credentials to replace.
     * @param numCredentials the number of credentials that should be kept.
     * @param maxUsesPerCredential the maximum number of uses per credential.
     * @param minValidTime requests a replacement for a credential if it expires within this window.
     * @param dryRun don't actually create the credentials, just return how many would be created.
     * @return the number of credentials created.
