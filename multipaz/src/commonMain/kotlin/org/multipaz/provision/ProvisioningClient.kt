/**
 * Interface to provision credentials, typically from a server (such as OpenId4Vci server).
 *
 * An instance of this interface provisions credentials for a single document.
 *
 * Provisioning is generally performed in this sequence of steps:
 *  - create appropriate [ProvisioningClient] using externally-supplied data, e.g. provisioning
 *   server and the protocol, or OpenId4Vci credential offer,
 *  - examine provisioning metadata returned by [getMetadata] to ensure that provisioning is
 *   feasible and to configure local systems, e.g. [SecureArea],
 *  - get a list of [AuthorizationChallenge] objects, each of which describes a particular
 *   way to authorize the user; once the list is empty, the user is fully authorized
 *  - select a supported/desirable way of authorization and supply necessary information using
 *   [authorize] method,
 *  - once user is fully authorized, obtain key binding challenge and create device binding
 *   key(s) to which credentials will be bound (this step is not needed for keyless credentials),
 *  - obtain credentials using [obtainCredentials] call.
