/**
 * This describes the protocol (messages and constants) between the device and the server
 * for the Cloud Secure Area.
 *
 * Throughout, the term _device_ or _client_ is used to refer to an Mobile Application (usually a
 * so-called Wallet App) and using a [SecureArea] implementation which is implementing this
 * protocol, for example the [CloudSecureArea] class.
 *
 * Similarly, the term _server_ or _cloud_ is used to refer to server-side of the Cloud Secure Area
 * and  _Secure Area_ is used to refer to the part of this server-side which may be implemented
 * in an isolated execution environment with additional protections.
 *
 * All messages in the protocol are encoded using [CBOR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949)
 * and is described here according to [CDDL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8610/).
 * Messages are exchanged using the HTTP protocol (HTTPS), using HTTP POST. It is not
 * required that the client supports HTTP cookies.
 *
 * One trait shared by all messages is that they are all maps and the `"type"` key has a
 * `tstr` value used to identify which message it is, for example `"RegisterRequest0"`
 * or `"E2EEResponse"`.
 *
 * The protocol consists of several flows
 * - Client Registration
 *   - This includes the client and the server exchanging keys (`DeviceBindingKey` and
 *     `CloudBindingKey`) to be used to bootstrap end-to-end encryption between the two parties.
 *     Each key has an attestation to allow both parties to authenticate each other.
 *   - The server authenticates the device using
 *     [Android Keystore Attestation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation)
 *     on Android and
 *     [DCAppAttestService](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/dcappattestservice)
 *     on iOS. This enables restricting the service to only authorized
 *     mobile applications that hasn't been tampered with and is running a known good environment.
 *   - The device authenticates the server by inspecting the root certificate of the
 *     attestation and making sure it trusts the public key in the root certificate.
 *   - Detailed description in [RegisterRequest0], [RegisterResponse0], [RegisterRequest1],
 *     and [RegisterResponse1] messages below.
 * - E2EE Setup
 *   - This involves the device and the server exchanging ephemeral keys (`EDeviceKey`
 *     and `ECloudKey`) which are signed by `DeviceBindingKey` and `CloudBindingKey`.
 *     These keys are used to derive symmetric encryption keys (`SKDevice` and `SKCloud`)
 *     used for AES-GCM-128 encryption.
 *   - The derived symmetric encryption keys are intended to only valid for a finite amount
 *     of time, 10 minutes for example. This is enforced by the server asking the device
 *     to go through the E2EE Setup flow again.
 *   - Detailed description for the E2EE setup flow is in [E2EESetupRequest0],
 *     [E2EESetupResponse0], [E2EESetupRequest1], and [E2EESetupResponse1]. See [E2EERequest]
 *     and [E2EEResponse] for how the symmetric encryption keys are used.
 * - Stage 2 registration
 *   - This runs after E2EE has been set up and allows for exchange of registration-related
 *     data which needs to be kept confidential. Currently this only includes the passphrase
 *     used to protect keys.
 *   - Detailed description in [RegisterStage2Request0] and [RegisterStage2Response0].
 *
 * The following flows are all implemented on top of E2EE and requires stage 2 registration
 * to be complete.
 * - Create Key
 *   - For every key created on the server, a companion key on the local device will
 *     be created in Secure Hardware (Android Keystore or iOS Secure Enclave). The local
 *     key is used to enforce User Authentication requirements using the native device
 *     unlock mechanism (e.g. biometric and passcodes).
 *   - See [CreateKeyRequest0], [CreateKeyResponse0], [CreateKeyRequest1], [CreateKeyResponse1]
 *     for a detailed description of this flow.
 * - Sign with Key
 *   - See [SignRequest0], [SignResponse0], [SignRequest1], [SignResponse1] for a detailed
 *     description of this flow.
 * - Key Agreement with Key
 *   - See [KeyAgreementRequest0], [KeyAgreementResponse0], [KeyAgreementRequest1],
 *     [KeyAgreementResponse1] for a detailed description of this flow.
 * - Passphrase check
 *    - The purpose of this is for the device to check ahead of time if the passphrase
 *      the user entered will work. This is useful for UX/UI flows where the client
 *      wishes to collect the passphrase before checking biometrics.
 *    - See [CheckPassphraseRequest] and [CheckPassphraseResponse]
 *
 * The protocol is designed so it's possible to implement a 100% stateless server except
 * that the server needs to possess a symmetric encryption key which never leaves the
 * Secure Area of the server. This key is used to encrypt/decrypt state shipped back
 * and forth to the client.
 *
 * Messages shall be sent from the device to the server as the body of a HTTP POST
 * request and messages from the server to the device shall be in the body of the
 * response. The server shall use HTTP status 200 for responses unless otherwise
 * specified.
 *
 * The following data types are used in the protocol:
 * ```
 * ; A chain of X.509 certificates.
 * ;
 * ; If the chain only contains a single certificate, a bstr with the encoded
 * ; certificate is used. Otherwise an array of encoded certificates is used.
 * ;
 * X509CertChain = bstr / [ bstr]
 *
 * ; A signature made with a Elliptic Curve Cryptography key.
 * ;
 * EcSignature = {
 *   "r" : bstr,
 *   "s" : bstr
 * }
 * ```
