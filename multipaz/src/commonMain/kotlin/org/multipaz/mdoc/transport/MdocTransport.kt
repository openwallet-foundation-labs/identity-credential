/**
 * An abstraction of a ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 device retrieval method.
 *
 * A [MdocTransport]'s state can be tracked in the [state] property which is [State.IDLE]
 * when constructed from the factory. This is a [StateFlow] and intended to be used by
 * the application to update its user interface.
 *
 * To open a connection to the other peer, call [open]. When [open] returns successfully
 * the state is [State.CONNECTED]. At this point, the application can use [sendMessage]
 * and [waitForMessage] to exchange messages with the remote peer.
 *
 * Each [MdocTransport] has a role, indicating whether the application is acting as
 * the _mdoc_ or _mdoc reader_. For forward engagement, if acting in the role [Role.MDOC]
 * the application should create one or more [ConnectionMethod] instances, call [open] on
 * each of them, share the [ConnectionMethod]s (through QR or NFC in _Device Engagement_
 * according to ISO/EC 18013-5:2021). Similarly, the other peer - acting in the role
 * [Role.MDOC_READER] - should obtain the _Device Engagement_, get one or more
 * [ConnectionMethod] objects and call [open] on one of them. For reverse engagement,
 * the process is the same but with the roles reversed.
 *
 * The transport can fail at any time, for example if the other peer sends invalid data
 * or actively disconnects. In this case the state is changed to [State.FAILED] and
 * any calls except for [close] will fail with the [MdocTransportException] exception.
 *
 * The connection can be closed at any time using the [close] method which will transition
 * the state to [State.CLOSED] except if it's already in [State.FAILED].
 *
 * [MdocTransport] instances are thread-safe and methods and properties can be called from
 * any thread or coroutine.
