/**
 * A helper for advertising a number of connections to a remote peer.
 *
 * For each [ConnectionMethod] this creates a [MdocTransport] which is advertised and opened.
 * The first connection which a remote peer connects to is returned and the other ones are closed.
 *
 * @param role the role to use when creating connections.
 * @param transportFactory the [MdocTransportFactory] used to create [MdocTransport] instances.
 * @param options the [MdocTransportOptions] to use when creating [MdocTransport] instances.
 * @param eSenderKey This should be set to EDeviceKey if using forward engagement or EReaderKey if using reverse engagement.
 * @param onConnectionMethodsReady called when all connections methods are advertised. This may contain additional
 * information compared to the original list of methods given, for example it may include the BLE PSM or MAC address.
 * @return the [MdocTransport] a remote peer connected to, will be in [MdocTransport.State.CONNECTING]
 * or [MdocTransport.State.CONNECTED] state.
