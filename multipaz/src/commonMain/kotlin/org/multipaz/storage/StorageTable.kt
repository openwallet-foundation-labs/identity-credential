/**
 * A storage unit that holds a collection of items. An item is a [ByteString] indexed by a
 * unique key.
 *
 * [BaseStorageTable] has two optional features: partitioning and expiration.
 *
 * When the table is partitioned, each item is actually indexed by a key pair (partitionId, key).
 * Keys are unique only within a particular partition.
 *
 * When item expiration is enabled, each item can be given optional expiration time. An item is
 * (conceptually) silently and automatically deleted once clock time goes past expiration time
 * (in other words, an item still exists at exactly the expiration time).
