         *
         * The tag content MUST be an unsigned or negative integer (major types 0 and 1) or a
         * floating-point number (major type 7 with additional information 25, 26, or 27). Other
         * contained types are invalid.
         *
         * Nonnegative values (major type 0 and nonnegative floating-point numbers) stand for time
         * values on or after 1970-01-01T00:00Z UTC and are interpreted according to POSIX [TIME_T].
         * (POSIX time is also known as "UNIX Epoch time".) Leap seconds are handled specially by
         * POSIX time, and this results in a 1-second discontinuity several times per decade. Note
         * that applications that require the expression of times beyond early 2106 cannot leave out
         * support of 64-bit integers for the tag content.
         *
         * Negative values (major type 1 and negative floating-point numbers) are interpreted as
         * determined by the application requirements as there is no universal standard for UTC
         * count-of-seconds time before 1970-01-01T00:00Z (this is particularly true for points in
         * time that precede discontinuities in national calendars). The same applies to non-finite
         * values.
         *
         * To indicate fractional seconds, floating-point values can be used within tag number 1
         * instead of integer values. Note that this generally requires binary64 support, as
         * binary16 and binary32 provide nonzero fractions of seconds only for a short period of
         * time around early 1970. An application that requires tag number 1 support may restrict
         * the tag content to be an integer (or a floating-point value) only.
         *
         * Note that platform types for date/time may include null or undefined values, which may
         * also be desirable at an application protocol level. While emitting tag number 1
         * values with non-finite tag content values (e.g., with NaN for undefined date/time values
         * or with Infinity for an expiry date that is not set) may seem an obvious way to handle
         * this, using untagged null or undefined avoids the use of non-finites and results in a
         * shorter encoding. Application protocol designers are encouraged to consider these cases
         * and include clear guidelines for handling them.
