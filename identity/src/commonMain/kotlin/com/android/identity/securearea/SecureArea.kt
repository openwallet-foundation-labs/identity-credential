/**
 * An interface to a Secure Area.
 *
 * This interface exists to abstract the underlying secure area used
 * used for creation of key material and other security objects related
 * to identity documents and associated credentials.
 *
 * A Secure Area may require authentication before a key can be used and
 * this is modeled through the [KeyLockedException] and [KeyUnlockData]
 * types. Applications will need to use Secure-Area specific mechanisms
 * to obtain the required authentication.
 *
 * Existing keys in a Secure Area may be invalidated and this can happen
 * on Android if e.g. the LSKF is removed or if a Cloud-based Secure Area
 * is turned down. This is modeled through the [KeyInvalidatedException]
 * being thrown when attempting to use the key. Applications can also use
 * [getKeyInvalidated] to learn ahead of time if a key is still usable.
