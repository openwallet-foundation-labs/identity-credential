/**
 * A simple non-distributed and non-persistent [PassphraseFailureEnforcer].
 *
 * The policy implemented is that the client is locked out if N failed passphrase attempts
 * has been recorded in the last M seconds.
 *
 * Assuming the passphrase is a 7-digit numeric PIN, this means that no more than N
 * PIN guesses can be done in M seconds. For N=3 and M=60 seconds, this translates
 * into a maximum of three guesses per minute meaning the probability to guess the PIN
 * in one minute is 3 in 10 million. The time to try all 10 million combinations is just
 * over 6 years and 4 months.
 *
 * The data is kept in memory only and not persisted so this is not appropriate to
 * use in a production environment.
 *
 * @param lockoutNumFailedAttempts the number of failed passphrase attempts before a client is locked out.
 * @param lockoutDuration the duration of the period to consider.
 * @param clockFunction a function to give the current time (used only for unit tests).
