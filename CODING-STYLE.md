# Coding Style

Our project follows the [standard Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
with the following changes

- We allow up to 120 characters per line, please use all of the available space.
- Only capitalize the first letter of words/acronyms/abbreviations/initialisms when using
  CamelCasing for example it's `UiTest`, not `UITest`, `IsoMdocType`, not `ISOMDocType`,
  and so on.
